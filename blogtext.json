But what do they really mean?\n\nMachine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It is a method of teaching computers to make predictions by feeding them data and allowing them to “learn” on their own.\n\nThe goal of Machine Learning is to create algorithms that can automatically improve given more data. For example, a machine learning algorithm can be used to improve the accuracy of a predictive model by increasing the number of training data points.\n\nMachine Learning algorithms can be used for a variety of purposes, including:\n\n1. Predictive Modeling – This is the most common use of machine learning. It involves using historical data to make predictions about future events.\n\n2. Clustering – This is the process of grouping data into clusters so that it can be better understood.\n\n3. Classification – This is the process of identifying which category a particular data point belongs to.\n\n4. Regression – This is the process of predicting future values based on past values.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is the broader field of study that encompasses Machine Learning. It is the process of making a computer system “smart” – that is, able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing objects, and making decisions.\n\nThere are various types of Artificial Intelligence, including:\n\n1. Machine Learning – This is the type of AI that we just discussed, which involves teaching computers to learn from data.\n\n2. Natural Language Processing – This is the ability of a computer system to understand human language and respond in a way that is natural for humans.\n\n3. Robotics – This is the use of robots to carry out tasks that would normally be done by humans.\n\n4. Computer Vision – This is the ability of a computer system to interpret and understand digital images.\n\n5. Deep Learning – This is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data.","error":"","reason":"","hitl_info":null,"warning_message":""}
